# PointCloudVisualizer
A JavaScript project to visualize point clouds obtained by my 3d Lidar room scanner, or any other csv point cloud.

The cloud constists over 1 000 000+ points obtained from a homemade 3d lidar scanner. The source code and cad design for this can be found on my github at https://github.com/robotevan/Lidar_Mapper_py3.

I may try to implement this into a website later.
